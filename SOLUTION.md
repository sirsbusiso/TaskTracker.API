# TaskTracker.API

LexisNexis Assessment : Task Tracker

Solution built in dotnet core 8 and the main functionality is to track task.

The architecture approach used is DDD with traditional repository pattern.

Clean soliuton that adhere to SOLID principle to promote clease code and easy maintenance

Did I encouter any issue that I needed to solve quickly?

- No, no major issue encounted fortunately except for normal build issues

Unit testing included?

- Yes, I included two test methods as instructed, I could add more.

Branching approach used?

- I used only master since it is a small solition but in the ideal world the approach will be branching from master to a feature and pull request to a release branch that is also from master and run the pipeline using a release and merge back to master once the feature is tested and stable on production environment.

How to run the solution?

- Since I used the in memory database and seeding there is no required actions to do except for running the project and test if needed.
